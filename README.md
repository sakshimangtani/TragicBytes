Track : Fintech
Problem Statement : With evovling of lavish lifestyle , people get difficulty in managing their finances and sometimes over spend and get short on their savings. 

Solution :  Cash Flow Management System 
The idea is to help people view and study their overall spend analysis by developing a mobile app to analyze all the purchases made by scanning a receipt. Use optical character recognition (OCR) to simply click an image of a receipt and track payments.
Using AI and machine learning, the app should be able to group items category-wise, for example, food, clothes, fuel, etc. The app should prompt users when they overspend or make repeat purchases.
